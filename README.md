## Algorithms

### Graphs

- Dijkstra (since `1.0.0`)
	- Find the lenght of the shortest path from `start` vertex to all of the others.
	- Find the shortest path from `start` to `finish` vertexes.

## Data structures

### Binary trees

- Hashed heap (since `1.0.0`)
	- Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the value of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the value of C.
